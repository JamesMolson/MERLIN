To build the Merlin library just open the Merlin solution file (Merlin.sln) in
Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition (VC++ 9.0) and Build. Default is to build the Realease version of the static library.

MerlinAll.sln is a solution to build the release and debug Merlin library and all examples. Just open MerlinAll.sln and build the solution. The default is static linking. The ROOT example is not built by default. You must first define the path to your ROOT libraries.
