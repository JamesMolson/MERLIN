Merlin simulations can be analysed with any data analysis tool. In this example the ROOT 
framework is combined with the SimulationOutput class. The example defines a wide variety of 
physical quantities, as Twiss parameters, first and second order beam moments and many more.

* For Linux the environment variable ROOTSYS must be defined to use the makefile.

* Please, copy and unzip the lattice file ILCDFS/ilc_linac_15_250.zip into this dirctory.

The example simulates an ILC like main linac. A wide variety of parameters and variables 
along the linac are written into root trees. In addition, the bunch can be dumped into 
another type of tree at arbitrary positions. See the main.cpp and TrackingOutputROOT.h for 
more details.

After running the executable there will be a merlin.root file.  The file contains several
trees of type TrackingTree and ParticleBunchTree.
